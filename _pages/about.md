Hi, I am Joe. Welcome to my website. I hope you may find something of interest here. My professional background is in physics. I earned my Ph.D. in 2016 at [The Ohio State University ](https://physics.osu.edu/). At Ohio State I was a member of the [Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics](http://ccapp.osu.edu/) (CCAPP). CCAPP is a world class research center focused on studies of dark energy, dark matter, the origin of cosmic structure, and high energy particle physics in the cosmos. I like to think (and lots of others think similarly) that CCAPP is interested in answering the coolest puzzles humankind has ever pondered. At CCAPP I worked with members of Ohio State's physics and astronomy departments. My Ph.D. thesis focused on cosmology. In particular I studied theories broadly concerned with the statistical relation between dark matter and galaxies. My research fits into the cosmological community's ultimate goal of understanding [cosmic expansion ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2434) (aka dark energy). I am very fond of the time I spent at CCAPP, Ohio State, and the city of [Columbus](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/ohio/why-columbus-should-be-on-your-travel-radar-hipster-city-ohio-next-brooklyn/). 

Originally, I am from Texas. In 2003 I moved to the San Francisco Bay area. I obtained my bachelor's in physics from San Francisco State University. I then moved to the Los Angeles area to pursue my master's at Long Beach State University. In 2010 I began my Ph.D. in Columbus, Ohio. I have recently relocated to Seattle, WA. I am looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my life.
