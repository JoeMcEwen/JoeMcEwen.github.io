This is currently under construction. Stay tuned.

Hi, I am Joe. Welcome to my website. I hope you may find something of interest here. 

I teach physics and scientific computation. Additionally, I have mentored and continue to mentor undergraduate students in topics ranging from galactic dynamics, general relativity, orbital mechanics, and collective motion in biology. 

My background is in physics. I earned my Ph.D. in 2016 at The Ohio State University. At Ohio State, I was a member of the Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (CCAPP). CCAPP is a world-class research center focused on studies of dark energy, dark matter, the origin of cosmic structure, and high-energy particle physics in the cosmos. I like to think (and others think similarly) that CCAPP is interested in answering the coolest puzzles humankind has ever pondered. At CCAPP I worked with members of Ohio State's physics and astronomy departments. My Ph.D. thesis focused on cosmology. In particular, I studied theories broadly concerned with the statistical relation between dark matter and galaxies. My research fits into the cosmological community's ultimate goal of understanding cosmic expansion. I am very fond of the time I spent at CCAPP, Ohio State, and the city of Columbus.

I am originally from Texas. In 2003, I moved to the San Francisco Bay area. I obtained my bachelor's in physics from San Francisco State University. I then moved to the Los Angeles area to pursue my master's at Long Beach State University. In 2010, I began my Ph.D. in Columbus, Ohio. In 2017, I moved to Seattle, WA. 

In my spare time, I often play guitar, attempt to learn drums, make bad music, ride my bike, write computer simulations for just about anything that I find interesting, and make authentic Texan food; chili and barbecue for example. 
 
Below is an animation, made in Julia, of particles moving in a fluid. The Chorin projection method was used to simulate the fluid.
