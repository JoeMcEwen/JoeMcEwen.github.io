## Physics 101
### VPython
Here is a link to my [VPython codes for physics](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/jmcewen314/folder/MyPrograms/). Just about all of this was developed in the rush to move online due to covid 19, hence, they are not polished. So far the codes are:
* projectile motion
* pendulum and double pendulum (students get a intro to chaos by examining the double pendulum)
* the mercury code is stolen from a lab write up on introducing general relativity
